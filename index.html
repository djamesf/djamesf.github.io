<h1>Phase 1. Forecasting, planning and activation - <strong>Planning before coding</strong> </h1>

<h2>Socio-cognitive Dimension </h2>


<p>Newman et al. (2004), divides the task or problem shared understanding in two parts: elementary clarification and in-depth clarification, 
linked respectively to problem/task identification and definition. During problem/task identification, learners discuss about a problem, identify 
its elements, and observe their connections for an initial understanding. For defining the problem/task, students analyze jointly a problem/task to 
come to a shared understanding which sheds light on the values, beliefs and assumptions underneath the statement of the problem/task. 
</p>
<p>

Järvelä et al. (2016), propose the identification and ranking the three most important things for the group achieve the objectives to address the difference of opinions within the group.
</p>
<p>
The shared understanding of program concepts involves the collaborative construction of the technical knowledge needed to build programs. A successful collaborative strategy for collaboratively building knowledge is the JIGSAW technique (Kordaki and Siempos 2011). Jigsaw is a productive learning strategy where students explain the subject they studied to someone else, usually their peers. The Jigsaw technique divides classes into mixed groups to work on small problems that the group assembles into a final result. For example, a classroom assignment is divided into topics. Students are then divided into groups with one member assigned to each topic.
</p>
<p>
Working individually, each student learns about their topic and presents it to their group. Then, students gather in groups divided by topic. Each member presents again to the topic group. In groups on the same topic, students reconcile points of view and synthesize information. They create a final report. Finally, the original groups come together and listen to each member's performance. Final presentations provide all group members with an understanding of their own material, as well as the findings that emerged from group discussion of specific topics.
</p>
<p>
As an example of a programming concept that must be built collectively, using the JIGSAW technique, we have the concept of program correction. Kolikant (2005) examined students' definition of correction, especially as it relates to tests. She found that students believe that a proper testing strategy includes testing every example they can think of, which is a strategy that instructors find incomplete.
</p>
<p>
The definition of correction used in Kolikant's research (2005) shows that the program should not present: syntax errors, logical errors and runtime errors (Jackson, 1996). Syntax errors will occur when a programmer misuses the syntax of a programming language. Logical errors (or semantic errors) will occur when a programmer's logical thinking is not correct enough. Runtime errors will occur in many situations. For example, if a programmer does not notice the domain of a variable's value, a runtime error ''overflow/underflow' may be encountered. In addition, it must pass the case tests stipulated by the professor and apply the control and data and control structures stipulated by the professor. The type of test case addressed in this research is the definition of expected inputs and outputs for at least one instance of each partition of the problem's data input domain (λ<inputs; expected outputs>λ). Example: Write a program that receives a positive integer as input and responds if the number is prime or not. λ< 5; cousin >λ; λ< 49; not prime >λ; λ< 37; cousin >λ; λ< 10; is not prime > λ;(λ< -15; bad input >λ; λ< icc; bad input >λ.
</p>

<h2>Socio-emotional Dimention </h2>

<p>
In order to anticipate good relationships in the group and stimulate fruitful interactions in the future, students should establish good rules of communication, assess how they feel about other members of the group and encourage self-assessment of their performance and involvement. Also try to understand what the group's objectives are and, with them in hand, try to integrate them so that everyone benefits. Manage various conflicting objectives and objectives, trying to agree on which objective will be accomplished first. Or when a person's goals do not match those of the group, they should try to reconcile these conflicting goals (Ullmann, 2016).
</p>
<p>
For example, during group programming, students can regulate each other through motivating and humorous phrases:
</p>
<p>
This code is really bad, we can only laugh about it, lol.
</p>
<p>
Let's persist! The program is taking a while to come out, lol. Let's focus!
</p>
<p>
The status of this Roman numeral code, Hahahaha.
</p>
<p>
This program is not so bad. Just delete the “main” role and do it again! Hahahaha.
</p>
<p>
The conversation is good, but the programming is more fun, lol. Let's go back to the code!
</p>


<h2>Socio-behavioral Dimension </h2>
<p>

In this phase, students must plan collaborative activities, setting up a task flow to be performed. Students should also discuss to reach consensus on the division of labor and time management (Zheng & Yu, 2016).
</p>
<p>
Scrum is a suitable method for managing collaborative programming tasks. Scrum is an agile method, based on an English sport called “Rugby” where players on a team are stacked, forming a wall. The method presupposes that, for a project to succeed, the people involved must always work together, engaged in a common objective. The method establishes three types of actors in the process, with their respective profiles.
</p>
<p>

● Scrum Master: Is the project leader, which facilitates communication, enabling the necessary conditions for the execution of tasks. The leader, who directs and facilitates the actions necessary for the success of the project.
</p>
<p>
● Product Owner: Is who represents the project's stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
● Team: Represented by the development team, that is, the people who develop the project. It is the actions of this team that determine the success of the project. With the participants well defined, the sprints are defined, established deadlines for the teams (students) to present their tasks, presenting the partial results of the project in question. A sprint is a short, limited period in which a Scrum team works to complete a certain amount of work. Sprints are at the heart of the Scrum method, and getting the sprints right will help your agile team deliver better software with less setbacks.
</p>
<p>
Tasks must be well defined and clear and must be organized into a list of priorities, the backlog. In agile development, a product backlog is a prioritized list of deliverables (such as new features) that must be implemented as part of a project or product development. It's a decision-making artifact that helps estimate, refine, and prioritize everything the team might want to accomplish in the future.
</p>
<p>
Summarizing the Scrum method in steps:
</p>
<p>
● Choose your roles: The team needs a Product Owner (has final say on project needs), a Scrum Master (helps the team take action and communicate), and team members. Remember, there is no room for egos in Scrum. Scrum works on a "leader serving the group" model.
</p>
<p>
● Create the Product Backlog: The Backlog is where the team will list everything the project needs, ordered by importance. Keep in mind that the Backlog is never complete. As the project takes shape, new needs arise and you add to the Backlog. The Product Owner is primarily responsible for this.

</p>
<p>
● Plan your Sprints: Next, it's time to choose the Backlog tasks to complete in your first Sprint. Sprints have a time limit, which the team mutually defines. During sprint planning, the team decides which tasks to include in the sprint, how long it will take to complete them, and who will be responsible for them. Create a visual board: Create a visual board to track actions by updating the board with each completed sprint.
</p>
<p>
● Get to work: It's time to get to work on this Sprint! Team members work on their tasks and everyone checks in on their progress.
</p>
<p>
● Reviewing Their Work: At the end of the Sprint, the team reviews the work done and presents its completed tasks. Each Sprint ends with a Review, or Retrospective, where the team reviews its work and discusses ways to improve the next Sprint.
</p>
<p>
● Repeat: With the first Sprint over, it's time to start all over again. Choose more Backlog tasks and repeat the process.
</p>
<p>
One of the fundamental characteristics of the Scrum methodology, and what makes it so potentially powerful, is the idea of repetition (or iteration) and improvement. This works both in relation to the product to be worked on and the efficiency of the team itself. At the end of each Sprint, the work should be ready to be handed over to a customer (in an educational context, the customer might be the teacher). This does not mean that it is a finished and complete project. Far from it. Rather, it means that the work must be sufficient to show some sort of completed “Minimally Viable Product” (MVP, in startup parlance).

</p>
<p>
Scrum is a good possibility to actively include students in the teaching-learning process. Appoint them as executors of a project, either for a project with a specific objective or even transforming the subject itself into a project with several actions to be carried out (works, tasks, assessments, etc.) engaging learning experiences. The Scrum method can help students assess the amount of work done, compliance with the release of activities in plans, productivity and ability to estimate effort (Mahnic, 2012). Effort regulation has a significant correlation with student performance in the learning process.
</p>
<p>
Empirical data showed that the Scrum method has the potential to be successful in educational projects due to its characteristics of adaptive planning, evolutionary development and flexible responses to changes. Estimating and planning are difficult tasks, but they can get better with practice.
</p>

<h2> Socio-contextual Dimension </h2>
<p>
Students can choose or not choose an agile computational tool like Trello for division of labor, definition of communication protocol and rules of engagement, assignment of specific roles within the group according to the profile of each student, such as, to define who will be responsible for the search for information or to detect problems of participation in the group (Zheng & Yu, 2016).
</p>
<p>
Posner and Baeker (1992) confirm that the assignment of roles in collaborative program writing offers participants the opportunity to write, consult, annotate and comment on specific parts of a shared document, allowing multiple cognitive strategies to be applied simultaneously. Roles can be fixed or dynamically changed. Posner and Baeker (1992) suggest four types of roles to be played by students when writing code: writer, consultant, editor and reviewer. The writer is responsible for transforming abstract ideas into coherent and organized code. The Consultant works closely with the writer but does not participate in the writing. The Editor makes changes to the code that was written. The reviewer makes comments about the document, which are accepted or ignored by the writer.
</p>



<h1>Phase 2. Monitoring - <strong> Monitoring during coding and testing</strong> </h1>

<h2>Socio-cognitive Dimension </h2>
<p>
This dimension addresses the awareness and monitoring of collective activities for possible adjustments. Awareness is a precondition for monitoring the group progress, generally subsumed as students’ perception and knowledge about a certain situation or as the understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for our own activity (Giglers et al., 2013).  
</p>
<p>
Monitoring group progress involves the detection of wrong ideas, paths, and cognitive conflicts, as well as validation behaviors as a reaction to the work progress and shared understanding. On one hand, cognitive conflict occurs when a student reject, deny or give a negative answer to/evaluation of what been sad or done before.  On the other hand, acceptance takes place when learners agree to what been said or done without further elaboration or when they adopt the perspectives of their peers and build syntheses of various arguments and counterarguments that learning partners have presented before (Omid et al., 2013). 
</p>
<p>
To increase learners’ awareness of their own and others’ learning process, Järvelä et al. (2016),  proposes the investigation and synthesis of students’ impressions about the learning situation before the activation of regulatory processes, such as  if they think the task is interesting, if they feel capable to perform the task, or if the students think the group is able to perform the task. 
</p>
<p>
Examples of discussions, during group programming, that can be carried out by students to raise awareness and monitor collective activities for possible adaptations are:
</p>
<p>
• Is more teacher feedback needed on programming logic, testing strategies, or other aspects involved in programming?
</p>
<p>
• Is greater synergy needed among the group during program development?
</p>
<p>
• What is the problem? What information was passed?
</p>
<p>
• What are we trying to solve? What input, processing, and output are required? • What is our plan and strategy?
</p>
<p>
• Are we using the best programming strategy to solve the problem, or do we need a different strategy?
</p>
<p>
• Do we need to re-plan the solution or are we on the right path?
</p>
<p>
• Are we close to finishing the program?
</p>
<p>
• What is the program's next step?
</p>
<p>
  • Did we agree on the computational solution to the problem? Is there another way to program the computational solution?
  </p>
<p>
• What would happen if we changed the code to …?
</p>



<h2>Socio-emotional Dimension </h2>
<p>
In the co-regulation of motivation and affect, individuals regulate each other’s learning predispositions to participate and interact in collaborations and the detection of emotional conflicts during the group interactions (Zheng & Yu, 2016).  
</p>
<p>
Monitoring the amount of interactions, as well as whether there is cordiality between the group is essential for maintaining a sense of belonging to the group. Students should inspect both the dialogues and the shared ideas, also monitoring the statements and other movements that provide the structure and organization for each situation within the group. The relations between the group members must be monitored, in order to facilitate the promotion of good interpersonal relationships. It is important to monitor connectivity within the group, that is, to try to understand if people are happy with the group's behavior, in order to get around a problem if it exists (Ullmann, 2016). 
</p>
<p>
Students should understand what the group's objectives are and, with them in hand, try to integrate them so that everyone benefits. Also manage several conflicting goals and objectives, trying to agree on which goal will be accomplished first. This type of problem can occur when a person's goals do not match those of the group, so this leadership profile must try to unite these conflicting goals (Ullmann, 2016).
</p>
<p>
Another important aspect that must be supervised are disrespectful negative socio-emotional interaction, such as undermining interactions, which would have led to conflicts and shown how certain patterns of interaction may be detrimental for collaborative learning (Isohätälä et al., 2020).
</p>
<p>
Examples of discussions that promote co-regulation and socially shared regulation of motivation and affect are:
</p>
<p>
• Were interactions in the group cordial?
</p>
<p>
• Was the quantity and quality of group member interactions satisfactory?
</p>
<p>
• Were everyone's ideas valued?
</p>
<p>
• Are we able to reach consensus when there are differences of opinion?
</p>


<h2>Socio-behavioral Dimension</h2>
<p>
For awareness on the group’s goals and progress, the use of an agile technology, such as Trello can help (Bolton & Emery, 2021).   Trello just like Padlet visually organizes the content and tasks. It enables visual organization of tasks, training materials and setting deadlines for their implementation as well as people responsible for individual parts of the task. Trello helps to organize tasks, plan, organize work, create lists and work on projects. We create our boards in the application, and we divide boards into lists with cards. Boards can be shared publicly or given access to others. In CSCL all students are responsible for knowledge advancement, so all students can act as agile coaches at the same time. Another unique feature of the use of agile technologies is that many students can also perform the same task, differently from the usual division of labor, where a task is assigned to one person.
</p>
<p>
The Scrum method is also effective for awareness and monitoring of group behavior when learning introductory programming.
</p>




<h2>Socio-contextual Dimension</h2>
<p>
For contextual co-regulations, the students can monitor rules of engagement, roles and communication protocols. The initial assignment of roles inside the group must be monitored, because the roles must not match the students’ profiles. The same applies to communication protocols and rules of engagement, that perhaps should be adapted (Li et al., 2020). 
</p>
<p>
Some strategies that can be applied while learning programming are:
</p>
<p>
• Schedule a meeting to define technologies such as Github and collaboration strategies, such as defining roles in the group;
</p>
<p>
• Organize an action plan and define which tasks will be carried out during the class;
</p>
<p>
• Define strategies, such as, for example, the use of the SCRUM method.
</p>



<h1>Phase 3. Control - <strong>Coding and testing</strong></h1>

<h2>Socio-cognitive Dimension </h2>

<p>

For the joint construction of knowledge, the group members can contribute with academic knowledge, based on the academic objective of the project, through the collaboration and presentation of new ideas and presenting their meanings through personal reading or scientific research correlated with the task. Students can seek information about the area studied, news about technologies that can be used in the study. Students can also contribute with new ideas and expand knowledge as a whole, giving their group valuable information about the content being studied. Try to relate some ideas or past work in order to reuse solutions, that is, apply the transfer of solutions from previously solved problems to new problems, abstract from similarities and apply productive experiences to new situations (Ullmann, 2016).
</p>
<p>
Students can search for information, so that to be successful in new discoveries, they must be aware of previous solutions and related solutions. For example, in the context of programming, students can detect relevant data and control structures, choose a suitable function from the programming language library, add or replace a command, condition or function call, etc. similarities, connections and previous instances, considering known problems. Students can also elaborate tasks for each one of the group, qualify, connect, relate and create content, assign degrees of difficulty on the studied theme and evaluate the quality of the works that have been developed and, with this information, try to increase the level of knowledge of group members. 
An essential aspect of collaboration is communication within the group. In this way, students can make statements that influence the topic of discussion or the direction of the work, being able to look at another side of a question, return to the original subject or create a new topic of discussion (Ullmann, 2016). To monitor the progress of group activities, students must keep abreast of what is happening in the group and work closely with the group as a whole, that is, they must know the work that is being done and how it is being done. in your working group in order to improve it. For example, be aware of the program execution sequence, where each instruction depends on previous instructions, be aware of the dependencies and independence between program variables, test the programs, among others. Students can also think about the consequences of misusing programming patterns, data structures and variables. But they can also innovate, creating a new code, developing a repertoire of patterns suitable for later adaptation, being aware that the patterns emerge from the fusion of two or more commands. Järvelä et al (2016) suggest students’ regulation of differences in perspectives and understanding related to the cognitive aspect of the task. 

</p>
<p>
In order to develop arguments, students can request reasons, evidence, evidence and clarification from others about what is studied, expanding the arguments of other members by refining those arguments or making productive comments about them. It should also instruct the group to justify its considerations so that new discussions and perspectives can emerge (Ullmann, 2016). Students can interact with other group members seeking to make decisions in a participatory manner, that is, they use information and suggestions from other team members in making decisions that will affect not only them, but everyone. Students can support decision making, qualify interactions (whether they are good, satisfactory, bad, etc.) and engage in negotiations within the group. They should try to promote creativity and critical thinking by instigating the members, requesting reasons, evidence and clarifications from these group members. Then you can try to evolve that thinking with new arguments and comments.
According to Newman, Webb and Cochrane (2004), for collaborative exploration of a task or problem the students need to get insights and understanding based on self and group learning. The skills needed to extend beyond the basis definition include inference: induction and deduction, admitting or proposing an idea on the basis of its link with propositions already admitted as true. But they also include the creative skills needed to widen the field of possible solutions. For problem integration the students need to propose coordinated actions for the application of a solution or following through on a choice or decision. This draws upon existing personal knowledge but is then validated within the group. This is a step where the solutions are grounded back in the real world.


</p>
<p>
For Teasley and Roschelle (1993), transactive discussion refers to a type of interaction in which each child uses his or her own conversational turn to operate on the reasoning of the partner or to clarify his or her own ideas. Transactive types of communication are the key to successful collaborations, encompassing 10 types of transactive statements: Feedback Request (Do you understand or agree with my position?) Paraphrase (I can understand and paraphrase your position or reasoning.), Justification Request (Why do you say that?), Juxtaposition (Your position is X, and my position is Y.), Completion (I can complete or continue your unfinished reasoning.), Clarification (No, what I am trying to say is the following.),   Refinement (I can elaborate or qualify my position to defend against your critique.), Extension (Here is a further thought or elaboration.), Critique (Your reasoning misses an important distinction, or involves a questionable assumption.), and Integration (We can combine our positions into a common view).
</p>
<p>
Learning computer programming is a difficult task that can benefit from the strengths of group work (Chorfi, 2020). Social interaction encourages people to share and generate different points of view and eventually expand their reflection beyond personal competences (Isohätälä, Näykki and Järvelä 2020). According to the idea proposed in Johnson (1998) which stipulates that “the process of analyzing and criticizing software artifacts produced by other people is a powerful method for learning programming languages and design techniques.
</p>
<p>
According to the idea proposed in Johnson (1998) stipulates that the process of analysis and criticism of software artifacts produced by other people is a powerful method to learn programming languages. Observing others' solutions is a strategy to gain multiple perspectives on problems needed while learning to program. Thus, regarding cognitive aspects, analyzing and building from third-party software artifacts is a good socially shared regulation strategy.
</p>
<p>
Some authors have emphasized the usefulness of collaboration in programming learning activity (Bouton and Garth 1983; Hwang et al. 2008; Sharan 1980; Slavin 1995), mainly in terms of student motivation and improvement of their participation in activities. During collaborative learning sessions, students achieve their learning goals through many activities, including assignments, working together, and skill sharing. Divide and conquer is a cognitive technique, but it can also be applied by the group, becoming sociocognitive, linked to a natural mode of interaction, adopted in programming to create a task distribution situation that requires co-presence.
</p>

<h2>Socio-emotional Dimension </h2>

<p>
For the co-regulation of friendly relations in the group, students must influence the group positively using language in an affective way and prone to motivate or inspire and encourage other members, thus providing positive interactions within the group. Everyone should show concern for the well-being of the group, check if the group is in harmony. For example, check that everyone is on the same page, asking if everything is okay, if something bothers a group member and then try to solve the problems listed by them in a fair and understandable way. 
</p>

<p>
They can also discuss with group members their concerns about the topic of study. For example, doubts about a specific subject or about the difficulties that the colleague may be facing in relation to the work being done. This will provide a well-being for the group members. 
</p>
<p>
Group members should be treated with respect and try to prevent disrespect among other members of the group. Trying to motivate, inspire and encourage group members, encouraging increasingly positive interactions (for example: Very good! Keep going as soon as we get there! Thank you! You helped us a lot now!). And you should not use language in a negative or critical way, as this can inhibit the success of the group (for example: You never do things right.). If this happens within the group, try to politely address the person who did it by eliminating this type of behavior pattern. In addition, encouraging the colleague to get it right and being supportive when making mistakes is a good practice that should be done by this leader (Ullmann, 2016). 
</p>
<p>
Students can encourage group members to express their ideas and opinions. That is, to instigate the other members of the group to give suggestions and information so that a decision can be made, for example, when there is an interaction or communication problem within the group, a question about how to improve this interaction can be asked and, from the answers, decide which of the suggestions is the best for the group and everyone can try to follow what was proposed.
</p>

<p>
Students can choose a leader to monitor and facilitate interactions, who should try to promote participation by encouraging people, asking for reasons, evidence and clarification from group members. Then you can try to evolve your thinking with new arguments and comments.
</p>

<p>
Some examples of phrases that the leader can use in introductory programming courses are listed below:
</p>

<p>
• Guys, our interaction is bad, let's try to improve.
</p>

<p>
• Guys, our motivation is bad, let's try to participate?
</p>

<p>
• Give your opinion on how we can accomplish this task.
</p>

<p>
• Why did you do this task this way and not this way?
</p>

<p>
• How did you make this part of the program? Why did you do it like this?
</p>

<p>
• Are there other ways to do this part of the code?
</p>

<p>
• How did you manage to program this without doing this?
</p>

<p>
• Your code for this problem works, but let's try to code it some other way to speed up the process?
</p>

<p>
• If anyone else has any other ideas on how to do this, let us know.
</p>

<p>
• Very nice people! We are evolving a lot, but we cannot stop.
</p>

<p>
• Guys, let's see if we can solve the problem?
</p>

<p>
• Let's set some goals, does anyone have any suggestions?
</p>

<p>
• The guy needs help guys, let's help him, does anyone know the answer or where to find it?
</p>

<p>
• Does anyone have any idea how I can solve this problem of mine?
</p>

<p>
• How do you think the program should be done?
</p>

<p>
• Do you have any suggestions on how we can do this work together?
</p>

<p>
• How can we divide the workload among everyone?
</p>

<p>

For the co-regulation of friendship relationships in the group, students must positively influence the group using language in an affective way and be willing to motivate or inspire and encourage other members, providing positive interactions within the group. Everyone should be concerned about the welfare of the group, check that the group is in harmony. For example, checking that everyone is on the same page, asking if everything is ok, if something bothers a group member, and then trying to resolve the issues listed by them in a fair and understandable way.
</p>

<p>
Group members should be treated with respect and everyone should try to avoid disrespect among other group members. Everyone should try to motivate, inspire and stimulate group members, encouraging increasingly positive interactions.
</p>

<p>
Students can use positive phrases such as:
</p>

<p>
• Very good!
</p>

<p>
• Keep going as soon as we arrive!
</p>

<p>
• Thanks!
</p>

<p>
• You've helped us a lot now!
</p>

<p>
• I liked your explanation, it was much clearer than mine! Without you we couldn't do it!
</p>

<p>

Students should not use language in a negative or critical way, as this can inhibit group success, such as: You never get things right. If there are personal conflicts or disrespect within the group, the student can politely address the person who did so, eliminating this type of behavior pattern. Students should encourage their peers to get it right and support them when they make mistakes.    
</p>

<h2>Socio-behavioral Dimension </h2>
<p>
For the regulation of group behavior, relationships of trust, awareness of participation in a group, and collective social identity must be established (Ullmann, 2016).  Students can encourage and encourage group members to promote high performance in their studies. To that end, they can recognize the group's efforts and encourage them to solve problems together. This can be done using phrases that demonstrate respect and well-being for the group, recognizing the work of the colleague and encouraging other people in the group to improve it. 
</p>

<p>
You can also encourage the group to set high performance goals. That is, when there is an impasse on some exercise, this leader will try, from the contributions, to show the best way to the solution so that everyone works together and define how far they need to go, what part of the work they need to do until a certain day, for example. 
</p>

<p>
Another student regulation may be to check the general contribution of other group members, seek help and encourage members to help, give and ask for advice for themselves and for other group members, to seek everyone's ideas about work. It also helps to help the teacher when a conflict of ideas does not reach consensus. This can make everyone involved in the work and the discussion flow more naturally (Ullmann, 2016).
</p>

<p>
Coding Dojo is a powerful strategy for socially shared regulation in programming. A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a group of programmers gather to learn, practice and share experiences. The Dojo plays an important role in learning to code, creating an environment to foster and share agile practices like Test Driven Development, Refactoring and Pair Programming. The main objective of a Coding Dojo is to learn through practice (Sato et al., 2008).
</p>

<p>
A Coding Dojo is a periodic (usually weekly) meeting organized around a coding challenge where people are encouraged to participate and share their coding skills with the public as they solve the problem. The main principles of the Coding Dojo are to create a safe environment that is collaborative, inclusive and non-competitive, where people can learn continuously. Some of the XP principles align well with this, such as Failure – it’s okay to fail when learning something new – Redundancy – you can always gain new insights by approaching the same problem with different strategies – and Baby Steps – each step towards success. solution must be small enough that everyone can understand it and replicate it later.
</p>

<p>
Sessions generally follow the same process:
</p>

<p>
• Choice of Issues (5-10 minutes): Prior to the meeting, participants receive an email with 3-5 choices of issues to be resolved. Problems are chosen from various sources (such as Ruby Quiz and Coding Challenges). Each option is presented briefly and participants vote on which problem will be solved.
</p>

<p>
• Problem Discussion (10-20 minutes): Once the problem is chosen, the group discusses the different approaches to solving it, usually ending with an agreed approach and a to-do list, to guide the peers through implementation.
</p>

<p>
• Coding Session (1-2 hours): With an agreed approach to solving the problem, participants begin the coding session in one of two formats – Prepared Kata or Randori. They should practice pair programming and test-driven development as a general rule.
</p>

<p>
• Retrospective (10-20 minutes): At the end of the session, participants stop coding (even if the problem has not been completely resolved) to reflect on the experience and share lessons learned with the group.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the Coding Dojo introduced two special roles that can be switched between participants, but which are very important for organizing and ensuring that meetings keep happening. The Moderator or Organizer is responsible for what happens before, during and after the meeting. It handles tasks like reserving the meeting room, sending reminders and options for issues to be resolved, setting up the computer and projector before the meeting, moderating discussions, conducting the retrospective, and cleaning up the room after the session. The Scribe is responsible for publishing the results of the session and sharing them with people who were unable to attend the meeting. He handles tasks like posting the session report, posting the final source code to the group, sometimes taking photos and documenting the results of the retrospective.
</p>

<p>
Participants are encouraged to develop the solution using Test Driven Development and are free to choose the programming language they prefer. There are two main meeting formats:
</p>

<p>
• Prepared Kata: In this format, someone has already solved the proposed Kata before the meeting (alone or in a group) and the solution is presented to the audience during the session. Instead of showing the final code and tests, the presenters start from scratch, explaining each step and allowing other participants to ask questions or suggestions. The goal of the session is for everyone to be able to reproduce the steps and solve the same problem after the meeting.
</p>

<p>
• Randori: In this format, participants solve the problem together, following TDD and Pair Programming in time-boxed rounds (usually between 5 and 7 minutes). At the end of each shift, the pilot joins the audience, the co-pilot becomes the pilot and a new co-pilot joins the audience duo. An extra rule is that discussions and suggestions should only be given when the pair reaches a green bar, with all current tests passing. The reason is that while at a red bar, the pair must focus and work together to pass the tests. The public can always suggest refactorings and optimizations in a green bar.    
</p>

<h2>Socio-contextual Dimension</h2>

<p>

In more student-centered classrooms, such as communities of learners, classrooms and project-based instruction, students are asked to do much more actual control and regulation of the academic tasks and classroom climate and structure (Agricola et al, 2020). They often are asked to design their own projects and experiments, design how their groups will collect data or perform the task, develop classroom norms for discourse and thinking, and even work together with the teacher to determine how they will be evaluated on the tasks. Of course, this does not mean that developmentally all students, especially those in the early elementary years, are able to regulate the academic tasks, classroom context, and themselves, but these types of classrooms do highlight the potential types of contextual regulation that is possible in the classroom context. 
</p>
<p>
A productive communication strategy that can be used to discuss the use of control structures in programming is the collaborative learning technique of discourse structuring called academic controversy (Johnson, Johnson, & Smith, 1996). For example, to decide which Selection framework, IF or CASE, is more appropriate for a teacher-given problem, academic controversy can be used.
</p>
<p>
Controversies arise when people's opinions differ on matters considered important by all involved. Perhaps the most cited benefit of controversy is that it stimulates thought. Dewey and Bentley (1949) explain: “Conflict is the fly of thought. It stirs us with observation and memory. Stimulates invention. He shocks us with the passivity of a sheep and makes us notice and invent... Conflict is a sine qua non of reflection and ingenuity”. Controversy can also provide a glimpse into the complexity of the real world and encourage tolerance for ambiguity. Encounters with a variety of viewpoints on a complex issue can lead students to re-examine and possibly revise their own ideas.
</p>
<p>
The basic steps in academic controversy are:
</p>
<p>
1. Students are in groups of four divided into pairs. Each pair is given one of two positions on a controversial topic, such as how humans should eat non-human animals. For example, one group of two might be assigned the position that we should eat our animal companions, while the other two should argue for the view that we shouldn't eat them. Students have time to prepare to present the best possible case for their assigned position, regardless of what their personal opinion is. By sharing and developing ideas with their peers, students can realize the value of cooperating with others.
</p>
<p>
2. Each pair takes turns presenting their assigned vision while the other two listen and take notes.
</p>
<p>
3. Each side engages in refuting the points made by the other side and defending the position they have advanced. Here is one of the places in the technique that can generate cognitive conflict. In addition, students need to think deeply to defend their assigned view, with facts, examples, and reasons.
</p>
<p>
4. Here is where academic controversy begins to differ from the typical competitive debate. Students switch positions and repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3 with the new assigned position. Again, they try their best to represent their assigned position. Just to be clear, Step 4 is actually three steps, as students repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3, but this time they represent the view they had previously argued against.
</p>
<p>
5. Students are no longer part of a group of two, nor are they assigned a role. Instead, in their group of four, they try to forge a common position, which could be one of the two views presented earlier and could also be another position on the issue. For example, they may decide that eating meat is fine, but it should only be done once a week. Students prepare to share this vision with others. If a group fails to reach consensus despite a sincere effort to do so, they are prepared to report the various opinions of group members.
</p>
<p>
The academic controversy in programming is exemplified below.
</p>
<p>
Individually: Students are in groups of four divided into pairs. Each pair is assigned one of two positions on a controversial topic, in this case using IF or CASE. Students are given time to prepare to present the best possible case for the assigned position, regardless of what their personal opinion is. One student from the first pair must look for arguments favorable to the use of the IF structure and the other student from the first pair must look for arguments against the use of the CASE structure. While, a student of the first pair must look for arguments favorable to the use of the CASE structure and the other student of the first pair must look for arguments against the use of the IF structure. The arguments must be based on theory and practice, and at least two versions of the algorithms must be implemented, one for each control structure.
</p>
<p>
In Group:
</p>
<p>
Each pair presents their point of view, while the other listens carefully and takes notes.
</p>
<p>
Each pair tries to refute the other's argument.
</p>
<p>
The group is reintegrated into four students, who evaluate the pros and cons and try to reach a consensus. If the group does not reach a consensus, they must prepare a report containing several points of view.
</p>
<p>
Individually reflect on:
</p>
<p>
With the use of the academic controversy technique, was it possible to examine and revise my ideas?
</p>
<p>
Did the use of the academic controversy technique allow me to envision and compare different solutions to the same problem, helping me to deal with ambiguity in different solutions?
</p>
<p>
Was it stimulating to research, apprehend, present and refute different points of view?
</p>
<p>
Do I intend to suggest the academic controversy technique in future group work?
</p>
<h1>Phase 4. Reaction and Reflection - <strong>Reflections on program coding</strong></h1>

<h2>Socio-cognitive Dimension </h2>
 

<p>
The behavioral processes covered in this dimension encompass the triggering, bringing together, evaluating, criticizing ideas. Here, it is evoked Dewey and Bentley’s  (1949)  notion of transactional inquiry to elaborate the creativity concept in a dialogic way. When participants engage in inquiry together, new meanings are created as a co-production. Also, by means of evaluations of ideas students are able to carry out decision making processes based on criteria application and improve ideas considering its bad features. 
</p>
<p>
Newman et al. (2004) corroborates this assumption. They advocate that the evaluation of alternative solutions and new ideas within a social context is essential for the development of good solutions. This needs judgmental skills of making decisions, statements, appreciations, evaluations and criticisms or "sizing up". 
</p>
<p>
Guilford (1950) reinforces the importance of reflection for creativity. He highlights the importance of the ability to consider and reconsider, to evaluate our ideas as well as the ideas of others; to take time to achieve understanding and insight, to look ahead and plan, and to visualize the complete picture. 
</p>
<p>
One important aspect of this phase and dimension is that when students evaluate and critique different perspectives and ideas they must be confronted with uncertainty and conceptual conflict. Both are states of disequilibrium that activate a process of conflict resolution and a quest for certainty (Dewey & Bentley, 1949) Here, the students are supposed to come up with, deepens and widens new ideas. They jointly build new knowledge by evaluating, comparing, selecting concepts and ideas, considering different alternatives, pointing positive and negative outcomes based in criteria application, starting a search for a more adequate cognitive perspective and reasoning process aiming to resolve conflict and uncertainty. 
</p>
<p>
Järvelä et al. (2016), propose a reflection on group discussions based on the reasons for the results obtained by the group. Group members should examine the explanations from the given options for decision making about the knowledge building.
</p>
<p>
In programming, joint reflection can explore different student solutions. According to Barr and Stephenson (2011), in relation to computational thinking, students need to understand that problems can be solved in several ways, having “flexibility tolerance” is a skill to be acquired. To show students that a computational problem can have multiple solutions, a collaborative strategy to share multiple solutions is alternative work (Chorfi et al., 2020), where different learners can develop alternative versions of the same code fragment. Such versions can be discussed below.
</p>
<p>
Examples of questions to think about comparing different versions of programs:
</p>
<p>
• Did evaluating different solutions together help you understand that there can be more than one program to solve the same computational problem?
</p>
<p>
• Did sharing different points of view help us in learning to program?
</p>
<p>
• Are we more confident that our solutions are correct?
</p>
<p>
• Did sharing different points of view help everyone in the group improve the quality of the code?
</p>
<p>
• Sharing knowledge allowed us to share skills with our partners?
</p>
<p>
• Was there faster correction of logic and syntax errors?
</p>
<p>
• Do we feel responsible about participating in tasks?
</p>



<h2>Socio-emotional Dimention </h2>
<p>
For the co-regulation of motivation and affect, the assessment of the emotional aspects of the group members, with respect to mutual respect and engagement in group activities is an important step (Webster, 2020). Previous performance measures past performances with the current performance. Normative criteria, contrary to mastery or previous performance, makes comparisons within a social group, i.e., about other’s performances. Finally, the criteria for collaborative evaluations involve making a team evaluation, which changes depending on different team endeavors. Järvelä et al. (2016), propose rating the motivations, searching for explanations, and evaluating their consequences for learning aiming further planning. 
</p>
<p>
Some questions that can be used by students for joint reflection are:
</p>
<p>
• Do we need to better respect the ideas of our colleagues?
</p>
<p>
• Do we need to commit more to collaborative program development? • How are you interacting in the group?
</p>
<p>
• How can we improve group interactivity?
</p>
<p>
• How is the dynamic of group participation?
</p>
<p>
• What can we do to improve everyone's participation? Students should reflect as a group on how their studies:
</p>
<p>
• If everyone could solve their doubts. Why?
</p>
<p>
  • If everyone is doing the work. Why?
  </p>
<p>
• If there are any patterns of behavior currently in the group that are bothering anyone.
</p>
<p>
• Whether connectivity within the group should be managed, ie try to see if people are happy with the group's behavior and try to resolve the issue if any. • It should be checked whether group members feel good about other members. Why?
</p>
<p>
• If you think that the group's evolution is good, be it in interpersonal relationships as well as those related to the work itself. Why?
</p>
<p>
  It is important to try to help colleagues solve their problems empathetically. Try to understand what the group's objectives are and, with them in hand, try to integrate them so that everyone benefits. Manage multiple conflicting goals and objectives, trying to reach agreement on which goal to accomplish first. For example, the following phrases should be used to promote reflection:
</p>
<p>
• Are you enjoying interacting with the group? Why?
</p>
<p>
•Is the way we interact in the group cool? Why?
</p>
<p>
• Are you enjoying the tasks performed? If not, what kind of tasks would you like to do?
</p>
<p>
•Are the tasks too easy or difficult? How can we help you?
</p>
<p>
•Are the tasks meeting your objectives? If not, we can help.
</p>
<p>
• Are you meeting your goals? If not, we can help.
</p>



<h2>Socio-behavioral Dimention </h2>

<p>
This dimension involves the evaluation of the group with respect to the amount of interactions and with how many different people interacted. Reflection on student participation is important for collective decisions about changing group strategies (Kaplan et al. 2017).
</p>
<p>
As previously stated, the Scrum method can be used to manage collaborative programming tasks and define roles to be performed by members, facilitating group interactions.
</p>
<p>
Some processes and questions that facilitate reflection during and after using Scrum are:
</p>
<p>
• At the end of the Sprint, the team reviews the work done and presents its completed tasks. Each Sprint ends with a Review, or Retrospective, where the team reviews its work and discusses ways to improve the next Sprint.
</p>
<p>
• Did Scrum help deliver small portions of the larger product and provide a flexible response to any changes deemed important by the team?
</p>
<p>
• Has the team's planning ability improved from Sprint to Sprint?
</p>
<p>
• Has Scrum helped reduce work waste, increase productivity and increase efficiency?
</p>
<p>
• Was the team able to dynamically adjust the level of work in progress to avoid being idle?
</p>
<p>
• Were the visual boards useful for coordination between the team and was the progress of tasks monitored?
</p>
<p>
• Has making work visible, especially seeing work-in-progress bottlenecks, lead to increased communication and collaboration?
</p>
<p>
• Did making the work visible help the team build improved team knowledge as a form of shared mental model?
</p>




<h2>Socio-Contextual Dimention</h2>

<p>
During collaborative learning, the students often are asked to design their own projects and experiments, work together in groups, design how their groups will collect data or perform the task, develop classroom norms for discourse and thinking, and even work together with the teacher to determine how they will be evaluated on the tasks. These types of classrooms obviously offer a great deal more autonomy and responsibility to the students and they provide multiple opportunities for reflections aiming contextual control and regulation, such as adapting group roles and communication protocols (Webster, 2020). Järvelä et al. (2016), propose rating the behaviors, searching for explanations, and evaluating their consequences for learning aiming further planning. 
</p>
<p>
Collaborative writing of program code is a strategy for self-regulation, co-regulation and socially shared regulation of context. Role assignment in collaborative writing provides an opportunity for participants to write, query, annotate, and comment on specific parts of shared code, allowing multiple cognitive strategies to be applied simultaneously. Roles can be fixed or dynamically changed. Four types of roles can be played by students when writing a program: writer, consultant, editor, and reviewer, as discussed earlier. Roles can be reallocated if the group so desires.
</p>
<p>
Examples of reflective phrases that can be used by students:
</p>
<p>
● Has role assignment during code co-writing increased productivity in solving computer programming problems?
</p>
<p>
● Was the strategy difficult to use? Because it is difficult to modify or criticize the work of others. Why?
</p>
<p>
● Was the strategy unproductive? Because the writer was very attached to his ideas, not listening to advice. Why?
</p>
<p>
● Did role assignment improve interaction among the group?
</p>
<p>
● Do we intend to continue using the role assignment strategy in future group studies?
</p>
